# Accordion

<p className="description">
  Accordions contain creation flows and allow lightweight editing of an element.
</p>

An accordion is a lightweight container that may either be used standalone, or be connected to a larger surface, such as a card.

> **Note:** Accordions are no longer documented in the Material Design guidelines, but MUI will continue to support them. It was formerly known as the "expansion panel".

## Basic accordion

<BasicAccordion />
```tsx
<BasicAccordion />
```

## Controlled accordion

Extend the default behavior to create an accordion with the `Accordion` component.

<ControlledAccordions />
```tsx
<ControlledAccordions />
```

## Customization

Here is an example of customizing the component.
You can learn more about this in the overrides documentation page.

<CustomizedAccordions />
```tsx
<CustomizedAccordions />
```

## Performance

The content of Accordions is mounted by default even if the accordion is not expanded.
This default behavior has server-side rendering and SEO in mind.
If you render expensive component trees inside your accordion details or simply render many
accordions it might be a good idea to change this default behavior by enabling the
`unmountOnExit` in `TransitionProps`:

```jsx
<Accordion TransitionProps={{ unmountOnExit: true }} />
```

As with any performance optimization this is not a silver bullet. Be sure to identify
bottlenecks first and then try out these optimization strategies.

## Accessibility

(WAI-ARIA: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#accordion)

For optimal accessibility we recommend setting `id` and `aria-controls` on the
`AccordionSummary`. The `Accordion` will derive the necessary `aria-labelledby`
and `id` for the content region of the accordion.
