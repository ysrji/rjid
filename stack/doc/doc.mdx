# Stack

<p className="description">
  The Stack component manages layout of immediate children along the vertical or
  horizontal axis with optional spacing and/or dividers between each child.
</p>

## Usage

`Stack` is concerned with one-dimensional layouts, while Grid that handles two-dimensional layouts. The default direction is `column` which stacks children vertically.

<BasicStack />
```tsx
<Stack spacing={2}>
  <Item>Item 1</Item>
  <Item>Item 2</Item>
  <Item>Item 3</Item>
</Stack>
```

To control space between children, use the `spacing` prop.
The spacing value can be any number, including decimals and any string.
The prop is converted into a CSS property using the `theme.spacing()` helper.

## Direction

By default, `Stack` arranges items vertically in a `column`. However, the `direction` prop can be used to position items horizontally in a `row` as well.

<DirectionStack />
```tsx
<Stack direction="row" spacing={2}>
  <Item>Item 1</Item>
  <Item>Item 2</Item>
  <Item>Item 3</Item>
</Stack>
```

## Dividers

Use the `divider` prop to insert an element between each child. This works particularly well with the Divider component.

<DividerStack />
```tsx
<Stack
  direction="row"
  divider={<Divider orientation="vertical" flexItem />}
  spacing={2}
>
  <Item>Item 1</Item>
  <Item>Item 2</Item>
  <Item>Item 3</Item>
</Stack>
```

## Responsive values

You can switch the `direction` or `spacing` values based on the active breakpoint.

<ResponsiveStack />
```tsx
<Stack
  direction={{ xs: 'column', sm: 'row' }}
  spacing={{ xs: 1, sm: 2, md: 4 }}
>
  <Item>Item 1</Item>
  <Item>Item 2</Item>
  <Item>Item 3</Item>
</Stack>
```

## Interactive

Below is an interactive demo that lets you explore the visual results of the different settings:

<InteractiveStack />
```tsx
<InteractiveStack />
```

## System props

As a CSS utility component, the `Stack` supports all `system` properties. You can use them as props directly on the component.
For instance, a margin-top:

```jsx
<Stack mt={2}>
```
