# Time Picker

<p className="description">
  Time pickers allow the user to select a single time.
</p>

Time pickers allow the user to select a single time (in the hours:minutes format).
The selected time is indicated by the filled circle at the end of the clock hand.

## Requirements

This component relies on the date management library of your choice. It supports date-fns, luxon, dayjs, moment and any other library via a public `dateAdapter` interface.

Please install any of these libraries and set up the right date engine by wrapping your root (or the highest level you wish the pickers to be available) with `LocalizationProvider`:

```jsx
// or @mui/lab/Adapter{DayJS,Luxon,Moment} or any valid date-io adapter
import AdapterDateFns from '@mui/lab/AdapterDateFns';
import LocalizationProvider from '@mui/lab/LocalizationProvider';

function App() {
  return (
    <LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDateFns}>
      ...
    </LocalizationProvider>
  );
}
```

## Basic usage

The date picker is rendered as a modal dialog on mobile, and a textbox with a popup on desktop.

<BasicTimePicker />
```tsx
<LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDateFns}>
  <TimePicker
    label="Basic example"
    value={value}
    onChange={(newValue) => {
      setValue(newValue);
    }}
    renderInput={(params) => <TextField {...params} />}
  />
</LocalizationProvider>
```

## Static mode

It's possible to render any time picker inline. This will enable building custom popover/modal containers.

<StaticTimePickerDemo />
```tsx
<LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDateFns}>
  <StaticTimePicker
    displayStaticWrapperAs="mobile"
    value={value}
    onChange={(newValue) => {
      setValue(newValue);
    }}
    renderInput={(params) => <TextField {...params} />}
  />
</LocalizationProvider>
```

## Responsiveness

The time picker component is designed and optimized for the device it runs on.

- The `MobileTimePicker` component works best for touch devices and small screens.
- The `DesktopTimePicker` component works best for mouse devices and large screens.

By default, the `TimePicker` component renders the desktop version if the media query `@media (pointer: fine)` matches.
This can be customized with the `desktopModeMediaQuery` prop.

<ResponsiveTimePickers />
```tsx
<ResponsiveTimePickers />
```

## Form props

The time picker component can be disabled or read-only.

<FormPropsTimePickers />
```tsx
<FormPropsTimePickers />
```

## Localization

Use `LocalizationProvider` to change the date-engine locale that is used to render the time picker.
The time picker will automatically adjust to the locale's time setting, i.e. the 12-hour or 24-hour format. This can be controlled with `ampm` prop.

<LocalizedTimePicker />
```tsx
<LocalizedTimePicker />
```

## Time validation

<TimeValidationTimePicker />
```tsx
<TimeValidationTimePicker />
```

## Landscape

<StaticTimePickerLandscape />
```tsx
<LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDateFns}>
  <StaticTimePicker
    ampm
    orientation="landscape"
    openTo="minutes"
    value={value}
    onChange={(newValue) => {
      setValue(newValue);
    }}
    renderInput={(params) => <TextField {...params} />}
  />
</LocalizationProvider>
```

## Sub-components

Some lower-level sub-components (`ClockPicker`) are also exported. These are rendered without a wrapper or outer logic (masked input, date values parsing and validation, etc.).

<SubComponentsTimePickers />
```tsx
<LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDateFns}>
  <ClockPicker date={date} onChange={(newDate) => setDate(newDate)} />
</LocalizationProvider>
```

## Seconds

The seconds input can be used for selection of a precise time point.

<SecondsTimePicker />
```tsx
<SecondsTimePicker />
```
