# Backdrop

<p className="description">
  The backdrop component is used to provide emphasis on a particular element or
  parts of it.
</p>

The backdrop signals to the user of a state change within the application and can be used for creating loaders, dialogs, and more.
In its simplest form, the backdrop component will add a dimmed layer over your application.

## Example

<SimpleBackdrop />
```tsx
<Button onClick={handleToggle}>Show backdrop</Button>
<Backdrop
  sx={{ color: '#fff', zIndex: (theme) => theme.zIndex.drawer + 1 }}
  open={open}
  onClick={handleClose}
>
  <CircularProgress color="inherit" />
</Backdrop>
```

## Unstyled

The backdrop also comes with the unstyled package.
It's ideal for doing heavy customizations and minimizing bundle size.

```js
import Backdrop from '@mui/base/Backdrop';
```
