# Links

<p className="description">
  The Link component allows you to easily customize anchor elements with your
  theme colors and typography styles.
</p>

## Basic links

The Link component is built on top of the Typography component, meaning that you can use its props.

<Links />
```tsx
<Link href="#">Link</Link>
<Link href="#" color="inherit">
  {'color="inherit"'}
</Link>
<Link href="#" variant="body2">
  {'variant="body2"'}
</Link>
```

However, the Link component has some different default props than the Typography component:

- `color="primary"` as the link needs to stand out.
- `variant="inherit"` as the link will, most of the time, be used as a child of a Typography component.

## Underline

The `underline` prop can be used to set the underline behavior. The default is `always`.

<UnderlineLink />
```tsx
<Link href="#" underline="none">
  {'underline="none"'}
</Link>
<Link href="#" underline="hover">
  {'underline="hover"'}
</Link>
<Link href="#" underline="always">
  {'underline="always"'}
</Link>
```

## Security

When you use `target="_blank"` with Links, it is recommended to always set `rel="noopener"` or `rel="noreferrer"` when linking to third party content.

- `rel="noopener"` prevents the new page from being able to access the `window.opener` property and ensures it runs in a separate process.
  Without this, the target page can potentially redirect your page to a malicious URL.
- `rel="noreferrer"` has the same effect, but also prevents the _Referer_ header from being sent to the new page.
  ⚠️ Removing the referrer header will affect analytics.

## Third-party routing library

One frequent use case is to perform navigation on the client only, without an HTTP round-trip to the server.
The `Link` component provides the `component` prop to handle this use case.
Here is a more detailed guide.

## Accessibility

(WAI-ARIA: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#link)

- When providing the content for the link, avoid generic descriptions like "click here" or "go to".
  Instead, use specific descriptions.
- For the best user experience, links should stand out from the text on the page. For instance, you can keep the default `underline="always"` behavior.
- If a link doesn't have a meaningful href, it should be rendered using a `<button>` element.

<ButtonLink />
```tsx
<Link
  component="button"
  variant="body2"
  onClick={() => {
    console.info("I'm a button.");
  }}
>
  Button Link
</Link>
```
