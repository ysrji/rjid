# Badge

<p className="description">
  Badge generates a small badge to the top-right of its child(ren).
</p>

## Basic badge

Examples of badges containing text, using primary and secondary colors. The badge is applied to its children.

<SimpleBadge />
```tsx
<Badge badgeContent={4} color="primary">
  <MailIcon color="action" />
</Badge>
```

## Color

Use `color` prop to apply theme palette to component.

<ColorBadge />
```tsx
<Badge badgeContent={4} color="secondary">
  <MailIcon color="action" />
</Badge>
<Badge badgeContent={4} color="success">
  <MailIcon color="action" />
</Badge>
```

## Customization

Here is an example of customizing the component.
You can learn more about this in the overrides documentation page.

<CustomizedBadges />
```tsx
<IconButton aria-label="cart">
  <StyledBadge badgeContent={4} color="secondary">
    <ShoppingCartIcon />
  </StyledBadge>
</IconButton>
```

## Badge visibility

The visibility of badges can be controlled using the `invisible` prop.

<BadgeVisibility />
```tsx
<BadgeVisibility />
```

The badge auto hides with badgeContent is zero. You can override this with the `showZero` prop.

<ShowZeroBadge />
```tsx
<Badge color="secondary" badgeContent={0}>
  <MailIcon />
</Badge>
<Badge color="secondary" badgeContent={0} showZero>
  <MailIcon />
</Badge>
```

## Maximum value

You can use the `max` prop to cap the value of the badge content.

<BadgeMax />
```tsx
<Badge color="secondary" badgeContent={99}>
  <MailIcon />
</Badge>
<Badge color="secondary" badgeContent={100}>
  <MailIcon />
</Badge>
<Badge color="secondary" badgeContent={1000} max={999}>
  <MailIcon />
</Badge>
```

## Dot badge

The `dot` prop changes a badge into a small dot. This can be used as a notification that something has changed without giving a count.

<DotBadge />
```tsx
<Badge color="secondary" variant="dot">
  <MailIcon />
</Badge>
```

## Badge overlap

You can use the `overlap` prop to place the badge relative to the corner of the wrapped element.

<BadgeOverlap />
```tsx
<Badge color="secondary" badgeContent=" ">
  {rectangle}
</Badge>
<Badge color="secondary" badgeContent=" " variant="dot">
  {rectangle}
</Badge>
<Badge color="secondary" overlap="circular" badgeContent=" ">
  {circle}
</Badge>
<Badge color="secondary" overlap="circular" badgeContent=" " variant="dot">
  {circle}
</Badge>
```

## Badge alignment

You can use the `anchorOrigin` prop to move the badge to any corner of the wrapped element.

<BadgeAlignment />
```tsx
<BadgeAlignment />
```

## Unstyled

The badge also comes with an unstyled version.
It's ideal for doing heavy customizations and minimizing bundle size.

```js
import BadgeUnstyled from '@mui/base/BadgeUnstyled';
```

<UnstyledBadge />
```tsx
<StyledBadge badgeContent={5} overlap="circular">
  <BadgeContent />
</StyledBadge>
<StyledBadge badgeContent={5} variant="dot" overlap="circular">
  <BadgeContent />
</StyledBadge>
```

## Accessibility

You can't rely on the content of the badge to be announced correctly.
You should provide a full description, for instance, with `aria-label`:

<AccessibleBadges />
```tsx
<IconButton aria-label={notificationsLabel(100)}>
  <Badge badgeContent={100} color="secondary">
    <MailIcon />
  </Badge>
</IconButton>
```
