# Lists

<p className="description">
  Lists are continuous, vertical indexes of text or images.
</p>

Lists are a continuous group of text or images. They are composed of items containing primary and supplemental actions, which are represented by icons and text.

## Basic List

<BasicList />
```tsx
<BasicList />
```

The last item of the previous demo shows how you can render a link:

```jsx
<ListItemButton component="a" href="#simple-list">
  <ListItemText primary="Spam" />
</ListItemButton>
```

You can find a demo with React Router following this section of the documentation.

## Nested List

<NestedList />
```tsx
<NestedList />
```

## Folder List

<FolderList />
```tsx
<FolderList />
```

## Interactive

Below is an interactive demo that lets you explore the visual results of the different settings:

<InteractiveList />
```tsx
<InteractiveList />
```

## Selected ListItem

<SelectedListItem />
```tsx
<SelectedListItem />
```

## Align list items

When displaying three lines or more, the avatar is not aligned at the top.
You should set the `alignItems="flex-start"` prop to align the avatar at the top, following the Material Design guidelines:

<AlignItemsList />
```tsx
<AlignItemsList />
```

## List Controls

### Checkbox

A checkbox can either be a primary action or a secondary action.

The checkbox is the primary action and the state indicator for the list item. The comment button is a secondary action and a separate target.

<CheckboxList />
```tsx
<CheckboxList />
```

The checkbox is the secondary action for the list item and a separate target.

<CheckboxListSecondary />
```tsx
<CheckboxListSecondary />
```

### Switch

The switch is the secondary action and a separate target.

<SwitchListSecondary />
```tsx
<SwitchListSecondary />
```

## Sticky subheader

Upon scrolling, subheaders remain pinned to the top of the screen until pushed off screen by the next subheader.
This feature relies on CSS sticky positioning.
(‚ö†Ô∏è no IE 11 support)

<PinnedSubheaderList />
```tsx
<PinnedSubheaderList />
```

## Inset List Item

The `inset` prop enables a list item that does not have a leading icon or avatar to align correctly with items that do.

<InsetList />
```tsx
<InsetList />
```

## Gutterless list

When rendering a list within a component that defines its own gutters, `ListItem` gutters can be disabled with `disableGutters`.

<GutterlessList />
```tsx
<List sx={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: 360, bgcolor: 'background.paper' }}>
  {[1, 2, 3].map((value) => (
    <ListItem
      key={value}
      disableGutters
      secondaryAction={
        <IconButton>
          <CommentIcon />
        </IconButton>
      }
    >
      <ListItemText primary={`Line item ${value}`} />
    </ListItem>
  ))}
</List>
```

## Virtualized List

In the following example, we demonstrate how to use react-window with the `List` component.
It renders 200 rows and can easily handle more.
Virtualization helps with performance issues.

<VirtualizedList />
```tsx
<FixedSizeList
  height={400}
  width={360}
  itemSize={46}
  itemCount={200}
  overscanCount={5}
>
  {renderRow}
</FixedSizeList>
```

The use of react-window when possible is encouraged.
If this library doesn't cover your use case, you should consider using react-virtualized, then alternatives like react-virtuoso.

## Customization

Here are some examples of customizing the component.
You can learn more about this in the
overrides documentation page.

<CustomizedList />
```tsx
<CustomizedList />
```
