# Paper

<p className="description">
  In Material Design, the physical properties of paper are translated to the
  screen.{' '}
</p>

The background of an application resembles the flat, opaque texture of a sheet of paper, and an application's behavior mimics paper's ability to be re-sized, shuffled, and bound together in multiple sheets.

## Basic paper

<SimplePaper />
```tsx
<Paper elevation={0} />
<Paper />
<Paper elevation={3} />
```

## Variants

If you need an outlined surface, use the `variant` prop.

<Variants />
```tsx
<Paper variant="outlined" />
<Paper variant="outlined" square />
```

## Elevation

The elevation can be used to establish a hierachy between other content. In practical terms, the elevation controls the size of the shadow applied to the surface. In dark mode, raising the elevation also makes the surface lighter.

<Elevation />
```tsx
<Elevation />
```
